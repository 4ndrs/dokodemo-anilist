## Installing & Building
Builds for installing and testing are available [here](https://github.com/4ndrs/dokodemo-anilist/releases). For building it yourself, you need [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your system, then you can proceed installing the dependencies and running the build script with Bun:

```console
$ bun install
$ bun run build
```
The built files will be available under the directory `dist`.

## Acknowledgements
I thought of Bocchi the whole time while writing this extension.
