# Dokodemo AniList (Unofficial)
A web extension to search for anime, manga, characters, staff, and studios using the AniList's API. It adds a new context menu option that can be clicked making a search bar (similar to the one on AniList) appear floating on the current page. If there is text selected, it will be used as a search term when clicking the option.

## Installing & Building
The extension is available for installing on AMO (https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/dokodemo-anilist). For building it yourself, you need [Bun](https://bun.sh/) installed on your system, then you can proceed installing the dependencies and running the build script with Bun:

```console
$ bun install
$ bun run build
```
The built files will be available under the directory `dist`.

## Acknowledgements
I thought of Bocchi the whole time while writing this extension.
